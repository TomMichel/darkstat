# darkstat
I made some modification to the darkstat source code, especially the export part

In the "out" repository you will find the output of the program, i.e. the in/out (bytes) total weight that comes in and out our interface
In the "src" repository you will find the sources files of the program

To install the program on your system, you have to type the following command while you are in the "src" repository:

sudo ./configure && sudo make && sudo make install
